This project was done after completing the course "Intermediate React" (Brian Holt)
https://frontendmasters.com/learn/react/

I highly recommend this course! I learned a lot of interesting things. 
For example:
- how to use portals and modals,
- how to increase performance with code splitting (lazy, Suspense)*
*I didn't use it on this project because it's too small, but it was very interesting information

This was not my first React project, so I integrated my own experience into the project.

Technologies used: 
- React, React Hooks, Custom Hooks, 
- TypeScript, JS,
- CSS Modules for layout,
- Jest (Unit tests, Snapshot tests)

I used my own design for this project.
